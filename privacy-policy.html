Please review our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (collectively the “Terms”) that govern the use of the Platform and Programs. This Privacy Policy shall form a part of the Terms by way of reference. All capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy, have the respective meanings set forth in the Terms of Use. This Privacy Policy applies only to the part of the Platform provided by  AlumnAI , and we are not responsible for the practices of persons, companies, institutions or websites that  AlumnAI  does not control, manage, or employ.</p>
        <p>Please understand that by using our Platform or submitting any Personally Identifiable Information (defined below) to us, you consent and agree that we may collect, use, disclose and retain your information (including but not limited to your Personally Identifiable Information) in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, and as permitted or required by law.

        <h5>1. INFORMATION COVERED BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h5>
        <p>Some of our Platform’s functionality may be used without revealing any personal information, though for features or services related to the Programs, personal information is required. If you do not use these specific features or services on the Platform, then the only information we collect will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., information that cannot be used to identify you). Non-Personal Information includes information such as the web pages that you have viewed. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Platform, you may need to submit “Personally Identifiable Information” (i.e., information that can be used to identify you).

You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personally Identifiable Information you submit to  AlumnAI . Inaccurate information may affect your ability to use the Platform, the information you receive when using the Platform, and our ability to contact you.

        <h5>2. INFORMATION COLLECTION</h5>

Collecting such information may involve logging the IP address, operating system and browser software used by each user of the Platform. Although such information is not Personally Identifiable Information, we may be able to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.</p>
        <p>1.2 PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION</p>
        <p>We collect Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to us when you sign-up for email updates or Programs, participate in our public forums, avail of our chat room services, send us email messages, and/or participate in online events or receive other services on or through our Platform.

        <p>AlumnAI , or its Educational Partners and third-party service providers, may, for instance, collect certain information from you in conjunction with assignments, exams and other assessments related to the online course. For example, as part of a proctored exam for a course,  AlumnAI  (or its third party service providers) may collect certain information from you in order to (a) verify or authenticate your identity or submissions made by you, such as a signature for a test or assignment log, a photograph or recording of you (e.g., using a webcam) or information included on a photo identification card or document, or (b) monitor your performance during an exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable test rules or requirements (e.g., confirming that you are not using prohibited resources).  AlumnAI  may also collect information from you or about your performance or accomplishments, such as quiz/exam scores, grades, project evaluations, teacher evaluations and other evaluations of your performance or accomplishments.</p>
        <p>1.3 THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</p>
        <p>We may receive Personally Identifiable Information when you access or log-in to a third-party site, e.g., Facebook, Whatsapp from our Platforms. This may include the text and/or images of your Personally Identifiable Information available from the third-party site. Please be aware that the information we obtain from such third-party Platforms is often dependent on their privacy policies and/or on your settings regarding what information you have consented to share with them.</p>
        <p>We enter into contracts with third parties to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this Platform. They may collect information about your visits to our Platform, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this Platform and to other websites so as to target advertisements for goods and services. This information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major websites. Such third parties are not permitted to sell or share your personally identifiable information as part of this process. If such third parties sell or share the personally identifiable information as part of the process,  AlumnAI  shall not be responsible.</p>
        <p>1.4 INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER SOURCES</p>
        <p>We may receive information about you if you use any of the other platforms we operate or the other services we provide. In this case we will inform you when we collect that data and that it may be shared internally and combined with data collected on the Platform. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, Educational Partners, sub-contractors in technical, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers) and may receive information about you from such sources. We collect Non-Personally Identifiable information from the Platform visitors to track the total of number of visitors to the Platform in aggregate form and identify the type of Internet web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer®) and operating system (e.g., Windows®) used by the visitor.

        <h5>3. USE OF INFORMATION</h5>
        <p>We may use the Personally Identifiable Information that you provide to respond to your questions, provide you the specific Program related information and/or services you select, send you updates about the Programs or other  AlumnAI  events, and send you email messages about Platform maintenance or updates, among other things.</p>

For example, as part of an exam,  AlumnAI  may use certain information collected from you in order to verify your identity, or to monitor your performance during the exam to confirm that you are abiding by the applicable testing rules or requirements. We may share Personally Identifiable Information that we collect from you when you participate in an Program with the particular Educational Partner (e.g., such as a university or company) that developed or offered the Program and the instructor(s) who taught, managed or otherwise oversaw the Program or graders who will be assessing </p>
        <p>your performance or mentors who will be supporting Students. For example, if you are taking a Program through a university, we may share Personally Identifiable Information about you and your performance with the university to report on your progress in the Program. In another example, if you are taking a Program sponsored or paid for by your employer, we may share your grades, evaluations, or progress in the Program with your employer and other Personally Identifiable Information. This information may be shared at any time during the Program or afterwards. Personally Identifiable Information shared with our Educational Partners will be subject to the privacy policies and procedures of such partners.

        <p>We may use your Personally Identifiable Information in order to provide such services to you and for quality control purposes, and we may also archive this information and/or use it for future communications with you. For example,  AlumnAI  may make available to you chat room services that allow you to communicate with  AlumnAI  staff members and we may use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide these services to you. Moreover, in certain circumstances, we may share certain Personally Identifiable Information and materials with third parties including but not limited to potential employers and/ or service providers such as Facebook in order to provide you services that you have requested or services  AlumnAI  provides in conjunction with the Programs.

These groups may be used to provide services in conjunction with the Programs including but not limited to updates in relation to the Programs, details of potential employers etc. Please be aware that the information disclosed on a third-party service providers platform will be dependent and subject to such third party’s privacy policies and/or on your settings regarding what information you have consented to share with them.  AlumnAI  and/or its associates shall have no liability in this regard whatsoever.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI  may use certain companies that enable you to establish a membership to participate in digital wallets, payment services or rewards programs. If you elect to do so, we will disclose to such companies your information necessary to make their programs work and support your membership with them.

Billing Information may be archived by us or our providers. We may archive Personally Identifiable Information other than Billing Information and/or use it for future communications with you.</p>
        <p>Our operations and maintenance contractors and other service providers may have limited access to your Personally Identifiable Information in the course of providing products or services to us.</p>
        <p>To the extent any Personally Identifiable Information collected by us contains images of you, you grant  AlumnAI  a limited, non-exclusive right to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of or publicly display such images and/or your likeness.</p>

In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also may share your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of  AlumnAI , the Platform, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms and other agreements.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI  may disclose and/or transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to an acquirer, assignee or other successor entity in connection with a sale, merger, or reorganization of all or substantially all of the equity, business or assets of  AlumnAI  to which your Personally Identifiable Information relates.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI  may share your Personally Identifiable Information with any Associate. The term “Associate” includes, with respect to any person, any entity that is controlled by such person, or any entity that controls such person, or any entity that is under common control with such person, whether directly or indirectly, or, in the case of a natural person, any Relative (as such term is defined in the Companies Act, 1956 and Companies Act, 2013 to the extent applicable) of such person.</p>
