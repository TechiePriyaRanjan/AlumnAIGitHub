        <h3>TERMS OF USE</h3>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>The website <a href="http://alumnai.mu/">www.alumnai.mu</a> and mobile apps (collectively the “Platform”) and the information, services and other materials contained therein are provided and operated by Alumnai Limited (referred to as “we”, “us” or “AlumnAI”). AlumnAI offers curated and specially designed higher education and industry relevant diploma and certification programs online (“Programs”).</p>
        <p>Please review our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and other policies available on the Platform (collectively the “Terms”) that govern the use of the Platform and Programs. Each Program may have a separate set of terms dealing with refunds, deferrals, payments etc. governing such Program and our corporate clients may have executed separate written agreements with us, which, in the event of a conflict, will supersede these Terms to the extent of the conflicting provisions. These Terms shall apply to AlumnAI hosted mobile apps, WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups, Instagram pages, Facebook pages, email/SMS/phone communications and other social media forums hosted by AlumnAI which shall be deemed to be part of the ‘Platform’ by reference. You acknowledge that certain parts of the Platform, as mentioned above, are provided by third party service providers, and you agree to abide by their terms and conditions. AlumnAI shall not be responsible for any disruption of services caused by such third-party service providers.</p>
        <p>Please note that the use of the Platform and Programs constitutes an unconditional agreement to follow and be bound by the Terms. Although you may "bookmark" a particular portion of the Platform and thereby bypass these Terms, your use of the Platform still binds you to these Terms.</p>
        <p>We may change these Terms from time to time without prior notice. You should review this page regularly. Your continued use of the Platform and Programs after changes have been made will be taken to indicate that you have read and accepted those changes. You should not use the Platform or Programs if you are not happy with any changes to these Terms.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI makes no representations that the Platform operates (or are legally permitted to operate) in all geographic areas, or that the Platform, or information, services or products offered through the Platform are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Accessing the Platform from territories where the Platform, or any content or functionality of the Platform or portions thereof is illegal, is expressly prohibited. If you choose to access the Platform, you agree and acknowledge that you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk and that you are solely responsible for compliance with all applicable laws.</p>
        <h5>User Conduct Policy</h5>
        <p>Whether you have enrolled for a Program or simply browsing the Platform, once you have accessed the Platform or Programs, you shall be considered a ‘user’ for the purpose of these Terms. You are responsible for all your activities in connection with the use of the Platform and Programs. You hereby agree to fully comply with all applicable local, provincial, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with such use. You shall not resort to any unethical practices while using the Platform.</p>
        <p>Without limitation, you will not post or transmit, or cause to be posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation or other "phishing", "pharming" or "whaling" message designed or intended to obtain password, account, personal information, confidential information or private information from any user of the Platform or any other third party whatsoever. However, if any such event does take place, AlumnAI shall not be liable for any loss in data or if the user’s device, computer or any other property is compromised in any manner.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that AlumnAI has the right to report any and all suspicious or illegal activity to the appropriate legal or police authorities without notice to you.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>harass other users, students, attendees, support agents or visitors;</li>
            <li>cheat on any homework assignment or exams for the Program;</li>
            <li>will not post online any secured testing materials;</li>
            <li>will not share solutions to homework assignments or exams; and</li>
            <li>will notify the instructors immediately if you become aware of any other user cheating or breaching these Terms, and will comply with the requirements of the specific applicable code of conduct, if any, relating directly to a Program in which such user is enrolled.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>User Accounts, User Registration and Delivery of Services</h5>
        <p>In order to participate in most Platform activities and to apply for a Program, you will need to register for a personal account (“User Account”) by providing an email address and a password that is unique.</p>
        <p>Upon payment of the Program fees – in part or whole depending on the Program, AlumnAI shall deliver the terms of use of the Program and will grant you access to the Program. The invoice may be provided to you along with the email confirmation or within two (2) months thereafter. This shall be proof of delivery against the successful payment of fees.</p>
        <p>Owing to certain exceptional circumstances, if AlumnAI has granted you access to a Program pending payment, and AlumnAI does not receive payments within the stipulated time periods, AlumnAI may, at it owns discretion withdraw your access to the Program, without giving any prior notice.</p>
        <p>You agree that you will never divulge or share access to your User Account, with any third party for any reason. You also agree that you will create, use, and/or access only one User Account, and that you will not use any User Account other than your own.</p>
        <p>In setting up your User Account, you may be prompted or required to enter additional information, including but not limited to your name and email address. Additional information may be required to confirm your identity. You understand and agree that all information provided by you is accurate, current and complete and that you will maintain and update your information to keep it accurate, current and complete. You acknowledge that if any information provided by you is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, we reserve the right to terminate your use of the Platform and your enrolment in a Program, to the extent applicable.</p>
        <p>In addition to the registration process, as part of your use of the Platform or participation in the Programs, we may obtain certain information about you and your performance in the Programs. Some of this information may be personally identifiable information. We may use, maintain, and store this information to provide certain services to you now and in the future and may share such information with our Educational Partners or third parties in conjunction with such services or for the purpose of marketing. For example, as further detailed in our Privacy Policy, we may share certain materials or information about you with third parties, including your grades/scores in our classes.</p>
        <p>Access to the Programs is restricted to attendees or students that have specifically been granted access by AlumnAI.</p>
        <p>By registering your User Account, you agree that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>you are registered for the Program only once and will not set up multiple User Accounts; and</li>
            <li>you will abide by these Terms and any terms specific to the Program.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additional requirements apply to Students. As a Student, in addition to the points above, you agree that you are registering with the intent to complete the assignments, if any, that are relevant and applicable to the Platform or Programs for which you have enrolled.</p>
        <p>Additional requirements apply to Students. As a Student, in addition to the points above, you agree that you are registering with the intent to complete the assignments, if any, that are relevant and applicable to the Platform or Programs for which you have enrolled.</p>
        <h5>Payment Terms & Refund Policy</h5>
        <p>Unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by AlumnAI, full payment for participation in a Program is required at the time of registration. In case of Programs that include a trial window, such trial window shall be made available only after full payment. During the trial window, upon a request of the Student, and to the satisfaction of AlumnAI, AlumnAI may choose to refund the Program Fees paid, subject to such charges as may be decided from time to time. Once the trial window has concluded, there will be no refund allowed for any reason whatsoever.</p>
        <p>It is the sole responsibility of the user enrolling for a Program to check the accuracy of, and evaluate the suitability and relevance of, the Program elected. The enrolment to a Program is non-transferable.</p>
        <p>To make payment for any Program or to purchase any services or products offered by AlumnAI through the Platform, you must have internet access and a current valid accepted payment method as indicated during sign-up ("Payment Method"). AlumnAI does not store any of your credit card information or such other information restricted by RBI for processing payment, and has partnered with payment gateways for the payment towards the services. By using a third-party payment provider, you agree to abide by the terms of such payment provider. You agree that in case AlumnAI’s third-party payment provider stores any such information, AlumnAI will not be responsible for such storage, and it will be solely at your discretion to allow the third party to store such information. Any loss of such information or any loss incurred by you due to usage of such information will be solely a loss incurred by you, and AlumnAI is in no ways liable for any such losses, and is neither responsible to reimburse / make good such losses in any manner whatsoever. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the payments made through the Platform.</p>
        <p>Failure to pay may result in withdrawal of your access to a Program. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or exchange rates.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of enrollment/purchase.</p>
        <p>You may cancel your enrolment at any time. Unless otherwise provided in your offer letter, no refund will be made once payment (in part or whole) for a Program has been made. We do not provide refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction.</p>
        <p>If you have subscribed for a free trial, the free trial period will last for the period of time specified during your sign-up. Free trials may not be combined with certain other offers. If you have subscribed to a particular paid service or product within the last six (6) months, or if your Payment Method, physical address or email address has been associated with an account for that paid service, you are not eligible to receive a free trial for that service or product. If you begin your subscription with a free trial, you may be ineligible for certain features of a product or service during your free trial period.</p>
        <h5>Use of Programs</h5>
        <p>AlumnAI reserves the right to cancel or reschedule any Program or live lectures/webinars, or to alter, modify or rearrange the schedule of topics, as well as the point value or weight of assignments, tests, quizzes, exams, projects and other such evaluations of progress. You also understand that AlumnAI, at its sole discretion, may limit, suspend, or terminate your use of the Platform or Programs and/or all AlumnAI-provided services related to the Programs, such as access to AlumnAI coaches or support services, evaluation services, or certifications. You also understand that AlumnAI may modify or discontinue all services related to its Programs at its sole discretion. You agree that AlumnAI shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to obligate AlumnAI to maintain and support the Platform or Programs or any part or portion thereof or any associated services.</p>
        <p>If you no longer wish to use any Program, you may terminate your participation by giving notice to AlumnAI.</p>
        <p>Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to obligate AlumnAI to maintain and support the Platforms, Programs or any part or portion thereof.</p>
        <p>Participants of AlumnAI online live lectures and webinars shall be provided access to such classes via email. You agree not to share such access with any third party. If you are unable to attend an online live lecture/webinar, please provide AlumnAI with prior intimation.</p>
        <p>You shall be exclusively responsible for obtaining and maintaining any equipment or ancillary services needed to connect to, access, receive or use the Platform, including, without limitation, hardware devices, software, and other internet, wireless, broadband, phone or other mobile communication device connection services. You shall be exclusively responsible for ensuring that such equipment or ancillary services are compatible with the Platform and shall be responsible for all charges incurred in connection with use of the Platform and Program in connection with all such equipment and ancillary services.</p>
        <h5>Educational Partners & Accreditation</h5>
        <p>AlumnAI is NOT a University, but an education service provider, offering Programs in consultation with Indian and International universities, educational institutions, governmental authorities, NGO’s, corporates etc. (each an “Educational Partner”).</p>
        <p>Admission to the degree/diploma programs of an Educational Partner is separate from being accepted into and/or taking one or more Programs. You agree and acknowledge that nothing in these Terms or otherwise with respect to the use of the Platform or any Program (a) enrolls or registers you in an Educational Partner, or any other school, division, institute or program of or associated with an Educational Partner, (b) allows you to access or use the resources or receive any benefits or privileges of any Educational Partner, beyond the Programs.</p>
        <p>AlumnAI may offer a credential or other acknowledgment for participants who have satisfactorily demonstrated mastery of the Program material. The decision to award any such credential acknowledgment to a given participant will be solely within the discretion of AlumnAI. AlumnAI may choose not to offer any credential or other acknowledgment for some Programs. It may decide at its sole discretion whether to provide a record concerning a participant’s performance in a Program. The format of any credential or other acknowledgement, and of any performance, provided by AlumnAI relating to Programs will be determined by AlumnAI in its sole discretion and may vary from Program to Program.</p>
